# BitmapPlusPlus Ruby

Ruby bindings for [BitmapPlusPlus](https://github.com/baderouaich/BitmapPlusPlus), a simple, fast, and lightweight C++ library for creating and manipulating 24-bit BMP images.

## Features

- Drawing primitives: lines, rectangles, triangles, circles
- Fill operations for shapes
- Pixel-level access and manipulation
- Image transformations: flip (horizontal/vertical), rotate (90 degrees)
- Load and save BMP files
- 32 predefined colors
- Iterator support for pixel enumeration

## About This Project

This gem serves as both a useful library and a **practical example of using [Rice](https://github.com/ruby-rice/rice) to create Ruby bindings for C++ libraries**.

Rice is a C++ header-only library that makes it easy to create Ruby extensions. See the [About Rice](about-rice.md) page for details on the Rice features demonstrated in this project.
